TODO: (Optional- Select one at least)
 Write a program that manages a list of up to 10 players and their high scores in the
 computer’s memory. Use two arrays to manage the list. One array should store the players’ names, and the other array
 should store the players’ high scores. Use the index of the arrays to correlate the names with the scores.
 Your program should support the following features:
    a. Add a new player and score (up to 10 players).
    b. Print all the players’ names and their scores to the screen.
    c.  Allow the user to enter a player’s name and output that player’s score or a message if that player’s name has not been entered.
    d.  Allow the user to enter a player’s name and remove the player from the list.
    Create a menu system that allows the user to select which option to invoke.
