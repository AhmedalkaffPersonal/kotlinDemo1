TODO : Mandatory
 Define a class called Vehicle that will be used to check the amount of fuel left in a
 vehicle after traveling a certain distance. The class should have the data variable
 tankSize to store the initial size of the tank and efficiency to store initial efficiency
 of the vehicle. Set to zero the variable fuelInTank that is used to store the initial
 amount of fuel in a tank. Include a mutator (Setter) method that returns iniTankSize,
 initEfficiency and fuelInTank. Include an accessor (Getter) method addPetrol that
 calculates how much fuel can be filled depending on the fuel existing in the tank
 and the tankâ€™s capacity. Also, include a method driveTo that returns what distance
 can be traveled with the available fuel and provided efficiency. Use your class with
 a test program. You should decide which variables should be public, if any. Also,
 define if any other function(s) are needed.
